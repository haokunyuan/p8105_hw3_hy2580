Problem 1
---------

Import and clean data

``` r
brfss_overallhealth = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # focused on Overall Health topic
  # checked response with distinct(), no pre-collapsed categories
  filter (topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  # take levels form excellent to poor by factorize response
  mutate(response = as.factor(response))
```

Find states were observed at 7 locations in 2002

``` r
brfss_overallhealth %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  distinct(locationabbr,locationdesc) %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(n == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   locationabbr     n
    ##   <chr>        <int>
    ## 1 CT               7
    ## 2 FL               7
    ## 3 NC               7

Make a spaghetti plot for number of observations in each state from 2002 to 2010

``` r
brfss_overallhealth %>% 
  distinct(locationabbr,locationdesc, year) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = year, y = n, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Observations", title = "Number of Observations in States (U.S.)", subtitle = "(2002-2010)")
```
